# Project Title: Employee Wellness and Absenteeism Analysis

**Description:**

The "Employee Wellness and Absenteeism Analysis" project is an advanced data analytics initiative aimed at optimizing employee wellness programs and gaining deep insights into absenteeism patterns within the organization. The HR department has commissioned the data analytics team to perform a comprehensive analysis of employee data to achieve three primary objectives:

**Task for Data Analysis:**

- Build a Database: Create a relational database for employee data, health metrics, attendance, and wellness participation.
- Develop SQL Queries: Write SQL queries to retrieve specific data, calculate absenteeism rates, and analyze health metrics.
- Perform Analysis: Identify eligible employees for the healthy bonus program and explore the relationship between smoking status and compensation.
- Connect Database to Power BI: Establish a connection between the database and Power BI for real-time data visualization.
- Build a Dashboard (WireFrame): Design a wireframe layout for the Power BI dashboard displaying key insights on employee wellness and absenteeism.

Objective 1: Healthy Bonus Program Identification
The first objective is to identify employees who consistently demonstrate good health and maintain a low absenteeism rate. To achieve this, the data analytics team will analyze a wide range of health-related metrics, including Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure readings, fitness levels, and overall wellness program participation. The team will also examine historical absenteeism records, considering factors such as the frequency and duration of absences. Based on predetermined eligibility criteria, the team will create a list of eligible employees for the healthy bonus program. The total budget allocated for the healthy bonus program is $1000 USD.

Objective 2: Non-Smokers Wage Increase and Compensation Adjustment
The second objective is to propose appropriate wage increases or annual compensation adjustments for non-smoking employees. The data analytics team will extract relevant employee data, including smoking status, salary details, performance metrics, and years of service. By conducting thorough statistical analysis, the team will identify correlations between smoking status and compensation. Leveraging market benchmarks and industry best practices, the team will suggest tailored wage 
increase proposals or compensation adjustments for non-smokers. The budget allocated for this initiative is $983,221 USD, dedicated solely to enhancing the financial well-being of non-smoking employees and promoting a smoke-free work environment.

Objective 3: Absenteeism Dashboard Development
The third objective is to create an interactive and visually-rich dashboard that empowers HR stakeholders to understand absenteeism patterns at work. The data analytics team will collaborate with HR managers to finalize the dashboard's wireframe, ensuring it aligns with HR's specific needs and key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard will utilize powerful data visualization tools, such as Power BI, Tableau, or custom web-based frameworks, to represent absenteeism trends, reasons for absences, department-wise absenteeism rates, and related productivity impacts. Users will be able to dynamically filter the data based on various criteria, such as time periods, employee categories, and departments, to gain granular insights. This dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for HR decision-making, allowing them to proactively address attendance issues and design effective employee wellness interventions.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. Eligible Employees List: The data analytics team will provide a comprehensive list of eligible employees for the healthy bonus program, accompanied by a detailed breakdown of health metrics and absenteeism records for each employee.

2. Non-Smokers Wage Increase Recommendations: A comprehensive report will be presented, outlining well-researched and data-driven proposals for wage increases or compensation adjustments tailored to non-smoking employees. The report will include a thorough analysis of salary data and market benchmarks.

3. Absenteeism Dashboard: The data analytics team will deliver a fully functional and user-friendly absenteeism dashboard, complete with interactive visualizations and customization options based on the approved wireframe. HR stakeholders will receive hands-on training to effectively utilize the dashboard for ongoing insights and strategic decision-making.
